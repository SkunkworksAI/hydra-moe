Firstly, it can help you to decipher the unwritten rules of a given society, as well as the way in which its members interact with one another. secondly, you can also pick up on certain nonverbal cues, such as body language or facial expressions, that can help to elucidate the culture's way of thinking. thirdly, by paying close attention to the reactions of others to your own behavior, you can get a good sense of what is considered appropriate or inappropriate. lastly, by noticing how people respond to one another, you can also glean clues about the expectations of the group. for example, in a large group of people, you can observe how they will react to certain statements or actions, and use that as a barometer to gage how the group at large may react.", "generation_truncated": "Observing the behavior of other people in a social situation can provide clues about cultural norms and expectations in a number of ways.
