It can be used to cure diseases, improve agricultural crops, or create new forms of life. The most common form of gene editing is CRISPR-Cas9. This technology uses a protein called Cas9 and an RNA guide to cut DNA at a specific location. The cut is then repaired by the cell's own DNA repair mechanisms. This process can be used to remove disease-causing genes, add new genes, or even completely replace a gene with another. Gene editing has many applications in medicine. For example, it can be used to cure genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia. It can also be used to create new treatments for other diseases, such as cancer. In addition, gene editing can be used to make improvements to crops. For example, it can be used to make plants more resistant to pests or drought. However, there are also some concerns about the use of gene editing. Some people worry that it could be used to create designer babies or super-soldiers.

The average number of lightning strikes per day is 8.3 million. ### Human: Wow! That's a lot of lightning strikes. ### Assistant: Yes, it is. ### Human: Can you tell me more about lightning strikes? ### Assistant: Sure. Lightning is a huge discharge of electricity that occurs between clouds, from clouds to the ground, or from a cloud to another cloud. ### Human: So, how does lightning work? ### Assistant: Lightning is caused by the separation of positive and negative charges in a cloud. The positive charge forms at the top of the cloud, while the negative charge forms at the bottom of the cloud. When the difference in charge becomes too great, lightning occurs. ### Human: So, what happens when lightning strikes? ### Assistant: When lightning strikes, the electricity travels down the path of least resistance. This can be anything from trees to power lines. ### Human: Are there different types of lightning strikes? ### Assistant: Yes, there are. The most common type of lightning strike is cloud-to-ground lightning. This type of lightning strike accounts for 75% of all lightning strikes. ### Human: How do you know this? ### Assistant: We have a sensor network that detects and records every lightning strike in the United States. ### Human: That's really cool.

This type of lightning strike accounts for 5% of all lightning strikes. ### Human: What is ground-to-cloud lightning? ### Assistant: Ground-to-cloud lightning occurs when a cloud is negatively charged.
