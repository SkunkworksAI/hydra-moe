Gene editing is a technique that has the capability to be used on any organism. Gene editing can be used in many ways, for example, to cure hereditary diseases or to improve crops. CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing technology that uses an RNA-guided bacterial enzyme called Cas9. CRISPR-Cas9 uses RNA to guide a protein called Cas9 to a target site on a genome. Once Cas9 locates its target site, it cuts and removes the target DNA. The DNA can be replaced with a new, modified version, and the enzyme is free to move on to the next location. CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to repair gene faults in a human genome, or to disable disease-causing genes. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can also be used on animals to improve their physical and behavioral characteristics. CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to make animals better suited for certain jobs, such as producing milk, or to improve their appearance. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can be used on crops to increase crop production and to make crops better suited for different climates.
