Therefore, 3.3 billion smartphone users sending an average of 100 texts per day leads to a total of 3.3 billion texts sent per day, or 350 billion texts sent globally per day."}

It is a way to measure a machine's ability to think in a way that is indistinguishable from a human's way of thinking. The test is usually carried out by a human conversing with a machine and a human, and determining which is which. If the machine is unable to be distinguished from the human, then it is said to have passed the test.", "generation_truncated": "The YouTube video would start with a brief introduction to the origins of jazz, its roots in the blues, and its evolution over the years.
