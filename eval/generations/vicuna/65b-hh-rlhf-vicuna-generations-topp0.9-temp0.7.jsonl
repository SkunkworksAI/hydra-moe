It\u2019s not the only way, and the \u201cold-fashioned\u201d (or classical) way to process information is to have a set of 0s and 1s and to have a set of rules to follow. So the question to the computer is: given the following set of rules, and the following set of 0s and 1s, do this. Quantum computing is different, and it\u2019s a whole different set of rules. And instead of using 0s and 1s, we\u2019re using a set of \u201cqubits\u201d (quantum bits). A qubit is a physical system that can be in one of two states, but it\u2019s not either/or. So for example, a qubit can be in a state of 0 or 1. Or, in a superposition of both, or a combination of both. A qubit can also be in a state of a little bit of both, or in a superposition of a little bit of both. I should add that a qubit is not a \u201cbit\u201d in the way we usually think of a bit, because a bit is a \u201c0\u201d or a \u201c1\u201d and is a set of rules. And in a qubit, it\u2019s a system that\u2019s in one of these two states. I should also add that a qubit can be in a superposition of all the states at once. This is a bit of a tough concept to understand. It\u2019s not quite the same as the state of both 0 and 1 at once, but it\u2019s a little like that. For example, the state of 0 and 1 at once could be 0.5, and that would be a \u201cqubit\u201d of the form \u201c0.5.\u201d A qubit can also be in a superposition of both 0 and 1, in a state of 0.5.

So in a given year, the Earth will have orbited the Sun around 365 times. In 4.5 billion years, the Earth will have orbited the Sun around 2,500,000 times. We can now take the square root of this, and this will be the number of orbits the Earth has made in that time.

Taking the square root of this, we find that in 4.5 billion years, the Earth will have orbited the Sun around 3,000,000 times.
