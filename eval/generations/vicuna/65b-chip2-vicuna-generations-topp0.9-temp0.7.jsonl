A common approach to building such systems is to first pre-train a large model on a set of natural conversations, and then fine-tune it on the task at hand. However, the pre-training step is inefficient as it requires a large amount of data and can only leverage the information in the most recent few words. To address this, we propose an end-to-end attention-based neural dialogue system (E2E-ATT), which does not require pre-training and can attend to the full history of the conversation when generating responses. E2E-ATT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Ubuntu and DailyDialog datasets, and it can even outperform a model with large pre-training data.", "generation_truncated": "There are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in a grain of salt.
