The mention of using a for-loop and set-operation is a good start, but it lacks clarity and precision. Assistant 1's answer could be improved by providing a clear code example and explaining the logic behind the solution.\n\nAssistant 2, on the other hand, provided a clear and concise code snippet that demonstrates a working solution to the problem. The code is well-structured, readable, and includes helpful comments that explain the logic and functionality. The nested loops and the check for duplicates make the solution accurate and efficient. Assistant 2's answer is almost perfect, but it could be slightly improved by mentioning the time complexity of the solution. Overall, Assistant 2's answer is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of the problem and coding abilities.", "score": [6.0, 9.0]}
