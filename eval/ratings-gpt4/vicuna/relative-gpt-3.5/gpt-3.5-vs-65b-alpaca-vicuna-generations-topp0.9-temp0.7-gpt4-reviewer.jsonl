They mentioned that a program can be implemented to find the common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures, but they did not provide any actual implementation or examples.\n\nAssistant 2 provided a clear and concise code snippet that solves the given problem. The code is well-structured, readable, and includes helpful comments. The function `find_common_elements` uses nested loops to iterate over both arrays and compare their elements. If a common element is found, it is added to a list called 'common'. The code also checks for duplicates before appending the element to the 'common' list. Assistant 2 also provided an example to test the function, which demonstrates the correct output.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n- Assistant 1 should provide a code snippet that solves the given problem, along with helpful comments and examples.\n- Assistant 2's code is already efficient and well-structured, but they could consider using a set to store the common elements, which would automatically handle duplicates and slightly improve the code's efficiency. However, this would go against the constraint of not using any extra data structures.", "score": [5.0, 9.0]}
