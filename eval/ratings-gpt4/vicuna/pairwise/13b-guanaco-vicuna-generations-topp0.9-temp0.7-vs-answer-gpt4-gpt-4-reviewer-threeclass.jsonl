They used the absolute value of the difference in the x- and y-coordinates, which is not the correct way to find the distance between two points. The correct method is to use the distance formula, as shown in my independent solution.\n\nAssistant 2's Answer:\nAssistant 2 used the correct distance formula and followed the correct steps to find the length of the line segment. Their answer of 10 units is correct.\n\n2", "score": 2}
