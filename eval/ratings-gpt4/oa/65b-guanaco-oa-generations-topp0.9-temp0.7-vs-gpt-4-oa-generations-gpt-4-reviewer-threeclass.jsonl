It also mentions the acknowledgment of other satellites in the NRO's fleet, such as the KH-11 and KH-12. The response suggests that the existence of the KeyHole satellites is widely reported and accepted by experts, despite the lack of official confirmation.\n\nAssistant 2's response, on the other hand, states that the NRO has confirmed the existence of the KeyHole series of spy satellites but has not disclosed their full capabilities. The response highlights that the information related to the functioning and capabilities of these satellites is classified and that exact specifications often remain undisclosed to protect national security interests.\n\nBoth responses provide useful information, but Assistant 2's answer is more direct in stating that the NRO has confirmed the existence of the KeyHole satellites, while Assistant 1's answer suggests that the existence is widely reported but not officially confirmed.
